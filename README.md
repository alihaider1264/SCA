# SCA Description and Installation

The SCA tool is designed for programmers beginning their journey in the computer science world. The goal
of our tool is to provide the user with helpful suggestions instead of unhelpful and ofen confusing errors
and warnings generated by compilers. The suggestions are designed to guide the user by promoting more 
reliable coding practices and "pushing" them in the right direction. We hope you find this tool easy 
to use and also beneficial in your coding endeavors.


To download the SCA tool:
Prerequisites => Must be running a Debian version of Linux 
                 (if you don't have a debian version of Linux you can always spin up a Virtual Machine).

1. Download the 'install_SCA_ubuntu.sh' file from the repo.
2. Run the script on your machine
    - You may need to give it permissions to execute on your machine
    - The command to do so is:  chmod +x install_SCA_ubuntu.sh
    - After that you can run the script with:  ./install_SCA_ubuntu.sh
3. After the script has run successfully it will have downloaded and installed all necessary requirements for
   SCA to run in a direcorty that can be found at ~/SCA (on your home directory). A picture of the directory
   structure can be found below.
4. To execute the SCA tool on your source code files, place the .cpp files you would like to have analyzed
   in the ~/SCA/user/source-code directory (see photo below)
5. Once you have your desired .cpp files in /source-code run the a.out file located in ~/SCA/core/src. This
   will perform the analysis on the source code files and produce subsequent html output files with a report
   of the errors, warnings, and suggestions to your source code files.
6. The html output files will be located in ~/SCA/user/output. The name of each .html will correspond with your
   source code file's name.
